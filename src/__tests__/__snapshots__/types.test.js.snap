exports[`Typed Wiring if a typed wiring does not provide serialize undefined should be passed into the child type serializers: on initial render 1`] = `undefined Details: This is my details`;

exports[`Typed Wiring if providing a type that has further types beneath in extend, serialize, and children should chain through: on initial render 1`] = `
------------- Indent One
............- Indent Two
`;

exports[`Typed Wiring if providing a type without children should not add any custom children: on initial render 1`] = `--------- Indent Type`;

exports[`Typed Wiring if providing a type without extend should just not extend anything: on initial render 1`] = `- Details Type Details: This is my details`;
